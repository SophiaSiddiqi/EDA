# Project Title: EDA and Predictive Modeling on Tips and Wages Dataset

## Overview

This repository houses my in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using various algorithms on the Tips and Wages dataset from Kaggle. This project is the culmination of my Data Analytics with Python course, demonstrating intermediate to advanced-level proficiency.

## Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and correlations.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize advanced models like Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and more to predict tips and wages.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive notebooks providing a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis and modeling process.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SophiaSiddiqi/EDA-and-Predictive-Modeling-on-Tips-and-Wages-Dataset.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd TipPredictor
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook:

   - `project.ipynb`: In-depth exploratory data analysis.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and other specified libraries
